This chip is used in two versions with 7 or 8 core graphics in MacBook Air; But in both versions, an 8-core CPU and a 16-core neural processing unit are available. Due to the much higher efficiency of the dedicated M1 chip, Cupertino residents produce the MacBook Air with a passive cooling system (without a fan). Apple says that the CPU inside the M1 chip is 3.5 times more powerful and 4 low-power cores, and its eight-core GPU. They also operate up to 5 times faster than the previous generation. On the other hand, thanks to the 16-core M1 neural processing unit, machine learning-based processes such as face recognition or object recognition are done up to 9 times faster. According to Apple, the M1 chip inside the MacBook Air is faster than '98 percent of laptops sold last year.' Apple says that thanks to the memory controller in the M1 and the new memory, the SSD modules of the MacBook Air are up to 2 times faster than before. ) and provides Thunderbolt 3 (40 Gbit/s bandwidth) to the user.
